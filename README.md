# Luxor to Unreal Engine 5 live-recording and live-production plugin. 
### This project is still a 'work in progress' and currently only has a single example showing a method for connecting avatars in LUXOR to characters in Unreal Engine 5.
### The binaries for this plugin were built for Unreal Engine 5.0.0 on Windows 10 64bit, the plugin should still work in Unreal 4 but please send me a note if you hit a snag.
### There is still so much to work on and I would love to keep adding features to this plugin. Please check back often to see if any new updates are out!
### This project requires Luxor mocap fusion (www.MocapFusion.com). Check the youtube video below for examples showing how to setup live motion capture in UE5 using the realtime mocap and avatars from Luxor.
