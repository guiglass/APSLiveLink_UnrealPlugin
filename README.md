# Luxor to Unreal Engine 5 live-recording and live-production plugin. 
### This project is still a 'work in progress' and currently only has a single example showing a method for connecting avatars in LUXOR to characters in Unreal Engine 5.
### The binaries for this plugin were built for Unreal Engine 5.0.0 on Windows 10 64bit, the plugin should still work in Unreal 4 but please send me a note if you hit a snag.
### There is still so much to work on and I would love to keep adding features to this plugin. Please check back often to see if any new updates are out!
### This project requires Luxor mocap fusion (https://www.patreon.com/prepstudio) version 3.6.3 or above. Check the [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjHMxbBzessAD-Hf4EHbngg?sub_confirmation=1) for examples showing .
